On many of my projects, I ended up going above and beond the requirements. I was very interested in integrating an Arduino with VR. I ended up doing two main projects. The first one was my own controller and game on an Oculus Go, and the second one was a utility to scan a room with LIDAR and view it in VR (in real time). I have documentation of both projects on YouTube above.",

A month or so later, the hand tracking came out and I messed around with the Oculus Integration package for Unity. Something that I had wanted to see in VR for a long time was a good hand tracking keyboard. I made 5 keyboards in total, with the majority of them being tree based, similar to the markup menus seen in Maya. The rest were typical keyboards, but after using them I realized they don't work well because there are no haptics.",

Speech Graphics works on automated facial animation, and they are very well known in the gaming industry since the software is used in almost every major AAA game. While I was there, I worked on a demo app that streams live audio to a webserver, and returns facial animation for an avatar in real time (while I can't show the app due to an NDA, a video of something similar is shown above). The tech I used included WebRTC, Unity, Xcode, C, C#, Golang, HTML/CSS/JS, and Autodesk Maya. One of the main reasons I enjoyed working on the projects I did was because of John and Attila, my supervisors, as well as Dimitrios, a coworker. I ask a lot of questions, but they were always there with answers and never got tired of talking to me. I had such a fun time working that I even had a 101.5 hour work week to meet an investor meeting deadline! Speech Graphics is listed as the best Scottish startup of the year- link above.",

      "For my third semester at CU Boulder, I had an independent study with my lab's supervisor, Daniel Leithinger. I wanted to use the new motion capture studio that we had recently aquired. It has real time streaming capabilities, and I could stream the data to Unity. At first, I wanted to create a Sketchup-like VR app, where you can draw on a 2d plane and it interprets the position into 3d space infront of the user. While I was able to make that mechanic, I ended up going for a more tilt-brush like app in the end. The most exciting part about this to me was designing the UI/UX for this app. UI/UX is still uncharted design territorry, since up until now everything has almost all been two dimentional. I came up with a modular way to create three dimentional marking menus for different tools in my application (similar to those in Autodesk Maya). This way, a user pressed a button and was able to quickly make a gesture to equip a tool. One of the other cool parts of the app was a custom 3d color picker I made.",

      "Project Skywave was my project during my first semester at CU. During my general engineering class, a group of me and 4 other students worked on a theory I had come up with. I found it diffuclut to come up with a project at first, since the class focused on designing products for impoverished areas/3rd world countries. Everyone else in the class came up with some ideas more hardware related than software, but I wanted to work on software. Because of this, I came up with a theory for blanketed internet access for impoverished areas. Using two Raspberry Pi's, some radio transmitters/recievers, and some physics I had found out about, we built a miniature scale skywave. A skywave is a type of light wave that bounces off of atmosphere reflecting down into another location on earth. I had figured out that you can bounce a certain frequency of radio waves off of ionized substances, like the ionosphere. Because we didnt have the budget for huge equipment, we used tinfoil to boucnce our radio waves off of, posing as the ionosphere. We came up with our own data transmission protocol, and was able to send text files from one Pi to another. With this, my team was given the award of best project in the class.",

We quickly realized the fuel to wait ratio problem. After loads of reaserch, we came up with the idea of slingshotting a pod between planets. Originally, we thought of building huge      gyroscopes around planes, and spinning them to sling the pods in different direcitons. Then, we found out about space elevators.
